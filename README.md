# About Me
I am Shawn Agarwal, I study Electrical Engineering at The University of Oklahoma pursuing my bachelor's degree.

I enjoy contributing to Open Source Projects and am very enthusiastic about new technology. I enjoy C, Python, and Rust and am currently learning TypeScript and Next.js.

Outside of tech, I love working out, drawing, and making music.
